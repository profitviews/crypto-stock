This blog will _effectively_ be an expansion on my previous one: [Multi-Asset Algorithmic Trading with Python: Extending ProfitView Beyond Crypto to OANDA Forex](https://profitview.net/blog/multi-asset-algorithmic-trading-with-python-extending-profitview-beyond-crypto-to-oanda-forex).  This time we'll be looking at the stock market, and more specifically the Bitcoin ETF of BlackRock.

This will give an opportunity to show how to use ProfitView but also, since we'll trade with Alpaca, the usage of its websocket streaming prices to construct a reasonable algo.
